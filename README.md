This random generator is based upon the rules found within the Dungeon Master's Guide for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons.
I am distrubiting this software under the GNU General Public License version 3.
I do not claim to own any references to any specific trademarks or copyrights of Wizards of the Coast, inc.
In the first version, I made it so that the program runs in the command line, and out of the default Java package, so you should be able to run it generically
right away.
Depending on my own personal use of the application, I might include GUI funcitonality in addition to the Command line functionality.
